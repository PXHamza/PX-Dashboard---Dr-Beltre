/**
 * Stages.gs — Dr Beltre pipeline stages for the "Funnel Stages" tab.
 *
 * Ordered as the client requested. The dashboard preserves this order in
 * the distribution chart and breakdown table.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - "Booked Consult" → "Booked Surgery" → "Qualified (Moving Forward)"
 *     is the happy-path progression.
 *   - "Unqualified" is the only stage that disqualifies a lead (see
 *     Qualification.gs).
 *   - "Waiting for Finance" is a parking state — leads here are still
 *     active in the pipeline, just blocked on external approval.
 *   - "GLP-1 Downsell" captures the alternate (lower-priced) product
 *     path — also kept active so leads here still count toward the
 *     pipeline volume.
 *   - The winning stage is "Won (GLP -1)" — that IS the win, and it's
 *     flagged won:true. Legacy rows with just "Won" still classify
 *     into this stage via the 'won' fallback keyword.
 *   - "No Show" is a terminal branch (pre-consult drop-off).
